<h1 align="center"> üì∑ Jeushi's Wallpapers </h1>
<p align="center">A place to store my collection of stolen wallpapers. Mostly from Booru, 4chan, the r/UnixPorn discord, and Pixiv. </p>
<p align="center">Also the file names are randomized because I am horrible at naming files as I am sure most people are.
<h2 align="center"> üì£ Regarding Image Size / Sources</h2>
<p align="center"> If you want the source for a specific image you have to reverse image search and look yourself I am sorry. A lot of these I did not directly source myself and cannot tell you exactly where to get it. Alternatively if you want to request an image in its original size you might want to ask around any wallpaper communities and/or reverse image search once again. If you want to submit an original sized image make a pull request.</p>
<h2 align="center"> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important </h2>
<h3 align="center">Note for artists</h3>
<p align="center">I do not own nor claim to own any of the media in this repository it is simply a collection of pictures that I think look nice as wallpapers. If you / or someone whom you represent has an issue with any of the content please contact me directly to receive credit or have the material removed.</p>
