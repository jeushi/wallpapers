<h1 align="center"> üì∑ Jeushi's Wallpapers </h1>
<p align="center">A place to store my collection of stolen wallpapers. Mostly from Booru, 4chan, the r/UnixPorn discord, and Pixiv </p>
<h2 align="center"> üì£ Regarding Image Size / Sources</h2>
<p align="center"> If you want the source for a specific image you have to reverse image search and look yourself I am sorry. A lot of these I did not directly source myself and cannot tell you exactly where to get it. Alternatively if you want to request an image in its original size you might want to ask around any wallpaper communities and/or reverse image search once again. If you want to submit an original sized image make a pull request.</p>
<h2 align="center"> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important </h2>
